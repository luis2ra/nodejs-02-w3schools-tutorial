Node.js Get Started


Download Node.js

The official Node.js website has installation instructions for Node.js: https://nodejs.org


Getting Started

Once you have downloaded and installed Node.js on your computer, let's try to display "Hello World" in a web browser.

Create a Node.js file named "myfirst.js", and add the code for tells the computer to write "Hello World!" if anyone (e.g. a web browser) 
tries to access your computer on port 8080.


Command Line Interface

Node.js files must be initiated in the "Command Line Interface" program of your computer.

How to open the command line interface on your computer depends on the operating system. For Windows users, 
press the start button and look for "Command Prompt", or simply write "cmd" in the search field.


Initiate the Node.js File

The file you have just created must be initiated by Node.js before any action can take place.

Start your command line interface, write node myfirst.js and hit enter.

Now, your computer works as a server!

If anyone tries to access your computer on port 8080, they will get a "Hello World!" message in return!

Start your internet browser, and type in the address: http://localhost:8080
